      My Answers:

    <div class="answers">
      <h3>1. Talk about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did. Briefly explain one challenge
you experienced in setting up this site and how you overcame it.</h3>
      <p>First, I reviewed on how to start using Netlify. I watched some videos to get an idea of how it works. One challenge I experienced is using Github. I had heard of Github in the past, even before it was acquired by Microsoft. But I hadn't really used it for projects. As always, I overcome this challange by looking up tutorials online. Just a side note, the only time I used Github is when I'm looking for a particular app. Like the other day, I was looking to download youtube videos, and I learned that there is a youtube downloader project in github that I can use for free.</p>
<h3>2. What did you think of our service during the time you used it? Provide some constructive criticism or some features that impressed you.</h3>
<p>I loved the smooth and easy setup/deployment process. It was almost too easy, I kept expecting a curveball.😅 <br> I can't think of any feedback at the moment since this is my first time using it. Maybe something will come up along the way, but for now, I'm just enjoying it. If I were to compare my first time experiences with Netlify, Wordpress, and Odoo, I can say this is by far the simplest and headache-free to learn.</p>

      <h3>4. Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, which you think are well done, and explain why you think they are well done.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/">Cloudflare Email Routing</a></p><p>I think that most Cloudflare documentation I've read are well-done. But I've provided this particular product, Cloudflare email routing, since this is the most recent documentation I've read when I was trying to setup my custom domain email. I find their documentation clear, with step-by-step instructions which is helpful for beginners or to those unfamiliar with the tool. I can also see diagrams or visual aids that can help me easily understand a certain workflow or how a product works. </p>
    <h3>5. Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think are two major challenges around DNS configuration for less-technical customers hosting websites.</h3>
      <p>I think the first major challenge around DNS configuration for less-technical customers would be understanding the what, when, and how. What record to use, when to use it, and how it works.<br>Incorrect record entries or even conflicting configurations call cause issues.</p> <p>The second challenge is the unfamiliarity of the proper steps/order in configuring the DNS. This could lead to SSL certificate validation issues. I learned that DNS records should be configured first, like adding the CNAME record before mapping the domain. Otherwise, it may prevent the validatin of the SSL certificate and it could result in a certificate name mismatch error or web browsers often display a warning such as "your connection is not private". <br> Aside from that, there is no immediate feedback during the propagation, which means it can lead to uncertainty whether the issue is resolved after trying to reconfigure the DNS records</p> 
      <h3>6. A customer writes in to Support saying simply that their “site won’t build”. You have access to their build logs, and there you see this error: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero
exit code: 2. You have no more information than this and the site’s source repository is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How would you troubleshoot this issue? What steps would you take? Also, please compose your best customer-facing first response.</h3><p>I tried searching the error code in Google and I see a few results. However, I think that without additional information and accessto the site's source repository, we won't be able to troubleshoot it properly and efficiently. For me, troubleshooting is identifying the root cause, apply solution, then test it. In this scenario, I would have to make a lot of assumptions/guesses which would not be efficient to both the customer and me. Whenever I lack information, the best next step is to probe further. If this is via email/chat, and with the available information and research, I would say someting like: </p>
<p>Hi (customer's name),</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out! I understand that your site isn’t building successfully, and I’m here to help.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve found so far with the available information I have: Your site build stopped because of an error in the process. This might happen if something is missing or set up incorrectly. But don't worry, let’s work through it together to find the cause and fix it!</p>
<p>Could you please share a bit more information about your site? For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tools you’re using to build it (e.g., Next.js, Hugo, or other frameworks).</li>
<li>Any recent changes you’ve made to your site or build settings.</li>
<li>The command you’re using to build it and the folder where your site files are stored</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, here are a few simple steps you can try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please run the build process on your computer if you can. For example, if you’re using a tool like Hugo or Gatsby, try running it locally to see if the same issue happens.</li>
<li>Please check if all the files and tools needed for the build are installed and up to date.</li></ol>
<p>If you’re still having trouble, please feel free to share any additional details or screenshots of what you’re seeing, and I’ll guide you step-by-step to get it fixed!</p>
<p>Let’s get your site up and running!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<h3>7. How would you set up an http 301 status redirect from “/netlify/anything” on your site, to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything. Please provide the redirect formatting here. Now, how about a proxy redirect? Please add that proxy redirect rule directly to your site. (Please add the proxy redirect to your website!)</h3>
<p>For 301 Redirect:<p>[[redirects]]<br>
from = "/netlify/anything"<br>
to = "https://www.google.com/search?q=anything"<br>
status = 301</p><p>As for Proxy Redirect, I've added the rule directly to my site</p><p>[[redirects]]<br>
from = "/netlify/anything"<br>
to = "https://www.google.com/search?q=anything"<br>
status = 301</p>    </div>
